    "# Ridge Regression\n",
    "* Ridge Regression shares the same assumptions as OLS, but Ridge Regression helps address multicollinearity and reduce overfitting. Ridge is particularly useful when you have a number of features and you want to keep all of them (as opposed to having weights go to 0 in Lasso)\n",
    "    * Linearity: There should be a linear relationship between the features and the target\n",
    "    * Independence of Errors: Errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. Patterns in a residual plot may suggest a lack of independence\n",
    "    * Homoscedasticity: Variance of errors should be constant. An example of heteroscedsticity (bad) is if you have a conal shape in your residual plot\n",
    "    * Normality of Errors: The errors should be normally distributed. Check the Q-Q plot - if the residuals are normally distributed, then the points should fall approximately along a straight line\n",
    "    * No perfect collinearity: Features are not perfectly correlated (perfect collinearity)"
